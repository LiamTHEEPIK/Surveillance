## Installation

To get started with the Surveillance system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LiamTHEEPIK/Surveillance.git
   cd Surveillance
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. It is recommended to create a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required packages using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up MongoDB**:
   Ensure MongoDB is installed and running. You can use a local instance or a cloud-based solution.

5. **Configure Nginx**:
   If you are deploying the application, configure Nginx to serve your Flask app.

6. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Flask server.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Access the Application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the user interface.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use it to monitor video feeds. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Upload Video**: Use the interface to upload a video file or stream.
2. **Start Analysis**: Click on the "Analyze" button to begin the detection process.
3. **View Results**: The system will display any detected anomalies along with timestamps and relevant details.

### Example Use Case

Imagine a shopping mall using this system to monitor customer behavior. The application can detect unusual patterns, such as someone lingering in a specific area for too long, allowing security personnel to respond promptly.
